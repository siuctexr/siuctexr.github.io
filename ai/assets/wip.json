        "description": "The Moche dominated Peru’s north coast from about 100-750/800 CE. It is well known for its remarkable naturalistic, sculptural art style, tremendously diverse subject matter derived from at least four parallel worlds the Moche conceived, and its narrative (story-telling) character. This art style is unique in the New World and is renowned for the exceptional array of finely crafted pottery vessels with exquisite realism as this vessel (ca. 200-350 CE) illustrates. It depicts a lizard ready to leap. It has inlays of Spondylus shell on its back. Lizards are active during the day but also spend much of their life underground. Thus, in Moche art they are sometimes shown accompanying the solar deity as well as the dead. Dimension_____. MALI."

        "description": "Both wild and domesticated animals from the natural world received a lot of attention and appeared in Moche sculptural renderings. As in the case of earlier Cupisnique art, known animals from the Amazon rainforest like the possible spider (Ateles sp.) or titi (Pitheciidae sp.) monkey may have been kept as exotic pets by the Moche. This vessel (ca. 250-350 CE) depicts a monkey climbing down from a tree branch.  Moche painted art on pottery is nearly always bichrome (dark red in cream or the converse) and complex motifs are typically executed in fine reddish lines as seen on this vessel. Changes in the form of stirrup spouts helped early investigators to determine the relative age of Moche vessels. Dimensions 18.6 cm high. "

As a being from the natural world, it carries a much mythological significance in traditional Andean religions. Note the marvelous glossy finish and somewhat human-like expression on the bird’s face. Its diagnostic features such as a wattle on the neck and a large comb or caruncle on the crown of the head are well captured. Moche vessels such as these were formed using two-piece molds, one of the techniques for which their artisans are best known and which distinguishes them from others. Dimension ___. MBCR."

This vessel depicts an individual with a cleft palate and deformed nose. Unlike the modern conception of bodily imperfections, individuals with physical defects, religious people and shamans of the later Inca Empire were thought to be quite magical.  There are many examples of Moche ceramics depicting individuals with varied physical defects such as this. This individual is depicted holding what appear to be two gourd bowls in their right hand, and a shallow pottery bowl in the left, possibly containing medicinal roots or forming part of a healing ritual. The individual is shown wearing a simple head cover and ear ornaments, and a simply decorated shirt or tunic with classic step designs and simplified representations of metallic sequin-like adornments on the cuffs. Unlike the preceding fully sculptural examples, only the head of the individual is rendered in three-dimensional sculptural form. In this case, a combination of hand formation and partial molding techniques were used in its construction. Dimension ____. Huacas de Moche."

On his back, he wears what may be a feline pelage. Although the body is rendered in realistic form with regular human proportions, the face and his association with a feline and an owl suggests a mythological character of the being. Owl is frequently represented in the Moche art, both in its natural and anthropomorphic form. Owl as a nocturnal creature and raptorial in nature is often associated with the death (underworld) and the night. Some scholars consider this being as the principal Moche deity-cultural hero (see Object#40, 42 and 43). Perhaps he is preparing to make a trip to the underworld. Dimension 25.2 cm high. ML. "

Manioc was one of the staple food items of the Moche. The identity of this being as the principal Moche deity-cultural hero is quite clear from various ornaments and facial features including the bulging eyes, large fangs, feline-head ear ornaments. This vessel (400-550 CE) reveals some basic aspects of the Moche religion and cosmology; that the key deities can assume different forms depending on contexts and activities they engage in. It also informs us that the Moche religion was animistic, and that deities are found in all manner of things and beings. Dimension___. Huacas de Moche."

Here, it holds a sacrificial knife, or tumi, in one hand, and a decapitated human head by its hair, in the other. This being has the head and wings as well as sharp fangs of what is believed to be a vampire bat. Thus, the being is sometimes called the Bat Demon or Bat Decapitator. As a nocturnal vampire bat, it carries symbolic significance of darkness and death. The shiny black finish is quite appropriate. Like earlier Cupisnique and later Sicán pots, these dark colored vessels were manufactured in oxygen depleted environments. The evenly placed dots originally had some mineral and/or shell inlays.

He is frequently depicted emerging out of some plant (as in Object #40) or animal. But more importantly, he is shown battling dangerous monsters and evil forces of the Moche world (see below).

He battles with the mythical being with a spherical body in one moment and with the Strombus (conch shell) Monster in another. We see a partial depiction of yet another battle with a Demonic Fish monster. Perhaps the Moche people conceived this deity to be the protector of their world and wellbeing.

Like his human warrior counterparts, Bird Warrior wears a two-piece tunic and headdress, and carries typical warrior shield, darts, and war club.  In addition to metallic embellishments in the forms of tumi knives (crescent shaped) on his helmet and back-flap, small metallic plaques and discs have been sewn onto the tunic. Adding to his imposing presence, Bird Warrior’s wings are spread as if in preparation for flight. Note the curious cactus and fig-like decorations in the background of the scene. Far from being random decorations, they help us to define the Bird Warrior’s role as a sacrificer. While the cactus is likely to represent hallucinogenic San Pedro cactus (Echinopsis pachanoi), the fig-like fruits may be the magical ulluchu that appear in several Moche sacrifice scenes and may have been used as anticoagulants in sacrifice ceremonies.

It is rich in artistic details it possesses; the warrior wears face, hand and foot paint as well as large earspools and an elaborate headdress adorned with a bat or feline. His pectoral is decorated with mythological double-headed snakes. However, he is not shown with bird wings as in the case of Object #47. It is probable that the seated individual is a human warrior wearing mask of a bird. There are Moche painted vessels that clearly show human warriors wearing a mask with a different bird head (e.g., with long, straight beak or a hooked beak) and a different head dresses who participate as runners in a race. It seems different warriors with different costumes raced on behalf of different sociopolitical or mythological groups. The individual on this vessel may be waiting for the start of the race.

This vessel depicts a couple that while possibly united in life, were certainly united in death. The living figure embraces the dead who is playing a panpipe.  He seems dead from the neck up (sunken eyes, eroded nose and exposed- teeth), and appears life-like from the neck down. Still bearing the accoutrements of his status and possible role, including headdress and ear ornaments, the partially skeletonized individual still plays the pan-pipe as he would have in life. Through this simple representation, we see that the living and the dead continued to interact beyond the confines of human existence. Dimension_____. Huacas de Moche."

The analysis also tells us that sacrifices were made at major mountains (at top or base) as shown in this vessel (ca. 400-500 CE) or on offshore islands (see Object #53). The dead body lying at the mountain base is believed to have been thrown from the mountain top to be sacrificed to the deity who inhabits the mountain. In the Andes, it is widely believed to this day that deities inhabit major mountains. The seated figure with an elaborate head-gear presumably supervised this sacrificial ritual. The smaller figures have fangs in their mouth and may represent assistants of the deity retrieving the sacrificed body.  Dimension 21.5 cm high. ML."

This pottery was excavated from a tomb at the base of the Temple of the Moon at the site of Huacas de Moche, the capital of the Southern Moche polity. What is painted is the deity of the sea (Pacific) rowing his crescent-shaped reed boat loaded with a fishing net and two pots. Lively swimming fish and flying sea birds surround the boat, which probably symbolized the moon that traveled across the sky during the night. The painting effectively tells us of the critical importance of the marine resources and the Pacific for Moche life. Dimension 30.0 cm. Huacas de Moche."
